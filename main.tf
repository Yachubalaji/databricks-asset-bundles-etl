# This Terraform scaffold is intentionally minimal.
# In real projects, you'd manage workspace-level resources (groups, permissions, policies, secrets, etc.)
# Jobs are NOT created here; jobs are deployed via Databricks Asset Bundles (databricks/databricks.yml).

# Example placeholder: show how you *could* define something infra-like (e.g., a secret scope),
# but keep it commented out to avoid accidental changes in your workspace.

# resource "databricks_secret_scope" "demo_scope" {
#   name = "bundle_demo_scope"
# }
